                <p class="card-text text-justify">For most divers, scuba diving is a highly visual experience – you dive to see what’s under the water. So it comes as no surprise that a top-quality dive mask is an important part of every diver’s gear, or that manufacturers continue to come up with new and more innovative masks practically every year. There is a large selection of features and styles, all of which makes it possible for the diver to pick the most comfortable mask that provides the greatest visibility for their individual needs.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Snorkels</h5>
                <p class="card-text text-justify">A snorkel seems simple enough – essentially, it’s a tube that you use to draw air from the surface while your face is in the water.
                But there are more variables than might first occur to you. The size of the bore (tube) of the snorkel is important. It has to be large enough for you to take a deep breath quickly and easily, but not so large that it adds unnecessarily to the volume of air you must move back and forth on each breath. <br>                
                The length of the snorkel is also important. It has to be long enough to stay above the surface while you swim, float, or otherwise rest or work at the surface. But too long a snorkel can be awkward, and can actually be harder from which to breathe. <br>        
                Gear manufacturers are more than familiar with all of these factors, as well as the ergonomics that make a snorkel comfortable to use. So if you choose a reputable brand from your professional dive retailer, you can rest assured you’ll get a solid piece of essential dive gear that works well.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Fins</h5>
                <p class="card-text text-justify">Years before scuba was invented, freedivers and underwater hunters used fins with mask and snorkel to increase their range, get down to depth more quickly, and provide bursts of speed as needed. Fins were created after observing the water-propulsion effectiveness of web-footed animals, such as ducks and frogs. In fact, many early fins were nearly exact copies of a frog’s fins – probably one of the reasons that early military scuba divers were nicknamed “frogmen.” <br>  Fins make swimming with foot-propulsion much easier, much more effective, and considerably more enjoyable. And because scuba divers are not only pushing themselves through the water – they are pushing their gear, as well – fins have been a part of scuba equipment since Day 1. Actually, since almost all of the early scuba divers were freedivers or snorkelers first, fins have been part of scuba since before Day 1.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Regulators</h5>
                <p class="card-text text-justify">Simply put, a scuba regulator is the device that delivers air to the diver and lets the diver breathe underwater. All regulators sold in professional dive centers today are reliable, and many have fantastic added features that make diving easier and more fun. Regulators deliver air to the diver by using two separate “stages” to reduce the high pressure of the air from the tank. Both stages working together make it possible for the diver to get air delivered at a pressure that is comfortable for breathing.
                  <br>
                Most modern regulators are of a “single hose” design, so-called because a single hose is used to move air from the scuba tank to the diver’s mouth, allowing them to breathe easily. The air moves first through a regulator first stage which is attached to the scuba tank, into the regulator’s second stage, which is the part through which the diver breathes. The second stage has a comfortable mouthpiece attached allowing the diver to breathe from it easily.
                  <br>
                If you look at them in cutaway drawings regulators may seem technical and complicated, but all modern first and second stages are actually very sound and straightforward devices, specifically designed to be tough and trustworthy.</p>
